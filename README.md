# AppSideBar Component

`AppSideBar` is a React component designed for creating a responsive and interactive sidebar navigation in your application. It supports click-outside-to-close functionality and customizable width.

## Installationgigit

Before using the `AppSideBar` component, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

After installing Node.js, you can install the `AppSideBar` component and its dependencies via npm (Node Package Manager).

### Installing Dependencies

Run the following command in your project directory to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom styled-components react-icons --save
```

This command installs `React`, `ReactDOM`, `react-router-dom` for routing, `styled-components` for styling, and `react-icons` which is used for icons in the navigation list.

## Usage

### Importing the Component

First, import the `AppSideBar` component into your React application:

```javascript
import AppSideBar from './path/to/AppSideBar'; // Update with the actual path
```

### Using the Component

Here's an example of how to use the `AppSideBar` component in a React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import AppSideBar from './path/to/AppSideBar'; // Update with the actual path
import { TempNavList } from './path/to/TempNavList'; // Update with the actual path

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <AppSideBar getNavigationList={TempNavList} width="250px" className="my-sidebar" />
      {/* Other components */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

In this example, `TempNavList` is a function that returns an array of navigation items for the sidebar. Each item in this array is an object that represents a navigation link or a group of links with sub-items.
